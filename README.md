# DeepGeophysicalInversion
Deep Learning framework to learn Geophysical Inverse problems.

Expected Progression.

I read more on how to do this, and gradient decent alone won't work.  They gradients need a hessian approximation to scale correctly.  Damn physics.

We will experiment with two methods:
  - 1 Use SimPeg as the inverse function and train with this.
  - 2 Use half inverse gradient.
